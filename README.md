# Ludo_route-
The User - User_name
The Computer - Ludo_dealer
Ludo_route, behaves like the Ludo game, two dice in curb. Each die have a 6 faces, numbering 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. the higest possible value player from a roll is 12, asnd the lowest is 2. In ludo_route, the final sum of each player tend towards 50, as 50 is the benchmark for winnning. If the final sum is greater than 50, the player automatically fails and the game ends.

the first time the user inters the game, he/she gets a question asking for name:
name = "What is your name?"
then, the user recieve
the information about the game he is about play once again:

In Ludo_route, you trive to become the "Ludo King." if you hit yes the first time you automatically get sum value from rolling 4 dice, then you either say yes or no whenever asked "Do you want to roll the dies," you can keep rolling the dice until your total, "User_ludo_sum" equals to 50. if you get a sum above 50, you fail "Oops, you've been looted"

the user_question = "name_user do you want to roll the die?"

rule for the ludo_dealer:
the computer is allowed to keep rolling his die until it have sum value of 45. then he stops rolling the die, if goes above 50, the ludo_dealer fails.

if ludo_sum >= 45 and ludo_sum < 50: the player gets a remarking saying in house, the player wins when the player hits 50, he receives a remark, "Ludo king"
